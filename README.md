Private statistics is an application which creates statistics about pacients' medical information keeping their data private.
The application is based on homomorphic encryption which makes possible operating on data without decrypting it. To enable sharing information with privacy we will use private set operations that allow two or more parties to compute operations on their sets (union, intersection etc).

<b><i>Similar applications are the following:</i></b><br>
1. Secure multi-party computation that allows companies to create different statistics about their health condition. The application runs on a browser and can be accessed by concurrent users. The application is availaible on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/proiect-taip/secure_multi-party_computation .
