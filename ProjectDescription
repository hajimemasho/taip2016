The application has five modules

Database Module:
- Manipulates data from DB: inserts, updates, selects and deletes records (insert, update, delete are only possible from within the module)

Utilities Module:
- contains all general data that is used by other modules.
- contains encryption and decryption of the data. This data is needed to be encrypted for the algorithms that will make private statistics.
- contains a base class extended by every other class that needs to have a logger for errors or success
- contains other classes that are useful clean code and best practices 

Queries Module: 
- implements the homomorphic operations add and multiply
- send the processed data to the interface
